## The 'Who'

French-born, Japan-based, I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building great user experiences. I'm currently working freelance to offer my services to companies and individuals.

I like to think I am a creative, sensitive and empathetic person. I'm also a bit of a perfectionist, which can be a good thing when it comes to building quality applications.

Far from being a nerdy IT guy in a basement, what I enjoy most of all is working with people and helping them achieve their goals.

I love to work on the road, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to travel and work remotely.



## The 'What'

I work for companies and individuals alike, and I'm always happy to help with any project, big or small.
